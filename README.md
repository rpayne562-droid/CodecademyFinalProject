This is my final project for Business Intelligence Data Analyst career path.  There are two parts to this.
1) An excel dashboard, car_insurance_premium_charts.xlsx, using car_insurance_premium_dataset.csv as data.
2) A python Jupyter notebook, FinalPortfolioProject.ipynp, using AutoInsurance.csv as data.
Both were used in Powerpoint presentations.
